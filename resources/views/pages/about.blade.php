    <h1><b>About RadioBlahBlah</b></h1>
    <p>So you want to know how it all began... <br> <br>
    Well it's rather simple... Simpler than you may think... <br><br>
    We started off as a few college kids ranting about life, school, especially school, work, and being broke.
    Billy had just spilled his mom's spaghetti all over his lap when genius struck! 
    There are a lot of college students just like us! They must be going through the same experiences. 
    They must be buying the same shrimp ramen at the grocery store after chicken runs out. (PS We all
    know chicken is the best...)   
    We should rant about our experiences together! That was the day RadioBlahBlah was born!
    <br><br>
    Since then RadioBlahBlah has transformed into a social event for college students everywhere to 
    express their frustrations and joys about life and the rad college experience. We've even grown to
    create blogs on things you care about like how do I make my last $20 last and is milk still good
    after the expiration date? <u>You ask and we tell!</u>
    <br><br> 
    <b>In short, RadioBlahBlah is for the people! We vent, rant, and learn a few useful tips along
    the way that your mother will never teach you, or your fancy professor.</b>
    <br>
    <i>Go on, ask them... They won't know, or admit to knowing...</i>
